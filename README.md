## Running Locally

1. Execute yarn to install the necessary packages.
2. Launch the Vite development server with yarn dev to initiate the project.
3. Generate JavaScript and CSS files for the release by running yarn build.
4. Once you've completed the yarn build process and your assets are generated, utilize yarn preview to locally preview the production build.
